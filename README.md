Automate actions on Omegle.

## Install

[**Chrome** extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omegle-automator/cjnledbijckhccgkhiamlpnpehfhcmkg)

## About

Automatically fill out interests and send messages using the Omegle Automator widget that will appear on the page after installing the extension.

The widget supports the input of multiple interests (ex. "youtube", "music", etc.) and a sequence of messages that can be rearranged and deleted from with ease. The "Wait-between" parameter can also be configured, which determines how many seconds should be waited between messages being sent.

After configuring your interests and a list of messages, you can press the "Play" button at the bottom of the widget to start the workflow. After that, the rest will be handled by Omegle Automator. It will delete old interests, enter in the new ones, start the chat, and start chatting with others.

What happens when Omegle Automator finishes sending the sequence of messages? It simply disconnects and starts a new chat. And what happens when the other person disconnects in the middle of the sequence? Omegle Automator will intelligently detect that it has been disconnected on and start a new chat, starting the message sequence over again.

## Why use Omegle Automator?

- Simple & accessible. Most Omegle bots require modifying configuration files and running them via your computer's terminal. This extension provides an easy to use draggable and collapsible widget that makes it simple to configure and start the bot.
- Reliable. I've built various Omegle automation tools (this is my fourth one), and have enough experience to understand and adequately handle all the edge cases the bot might be put through.
- Configurable. It's easy to add/remove messages to your sequence, as well as rearrange them by dragging them up or down.
